- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anirudh-Kulkarni.  Check out my [portfolio website](https://anirudh-kulkarni.github.io) here.

- I currently write documentation for cloud-related products at MathWorks, including offerings related to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Docker. In this role, I translate complex technical concepts into clear, user-friendly content. I have also written a few workflows related to machine learning and deep learning in the cloud.
  
- 👀 I worked previously in research. I worked as a Research Associate (Postdoc) in the lab of Dr. Tobias Reichenbach at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. I develop algorithms to analyse neural data obtained through various experimental procedures and computational models 
to help explain the underlying neural principles. I have also done many courses on Data science, Machine learning, and Deep Learning to keep up with the world of AI.

- 🎓 Prior to that, I worked with Dr. Romain Brette on understanding the action potential mechanism in Paramecium at the Institut de la Vision in Paris. Prior to that, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Statistical Physics (Computational Neuroscience) in 2017 from Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris while working at Laboratoire de Physique Statistique, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris where I researched on propagation of brain waves in the group of Dr. Vincent Hakim and on the Motion After Effect illusion and glial cells in zebrafish in the group of Dr. German Sumbre. I did my masters in Optics, Nanosciences and Condensed Matter Physics at Ecole Polytechnique  in Paris and my undergraduate major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Theoretical Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai. 

- 🌱 I enjoy teaching and had been a Teaching Assistant for the courses of Probability and Statistics, Computational Neuroscience and Reinforcement learning. I currently also work as a tutor in Further Maths for A-level students. 

- 💞️ In my free time, I like to do some science dissemination and recently started a [Science Blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@vigyaan) 
exploring various new advances in science. I also volunteer for the [Science Museum](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk). If you are in London, do come to one of my tours.

- 📫 Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirkulk/) or send me any email at anirudh [dot] kulkarni08 [at] gmail[dot]com for any discussion/collaborations.
