- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anirudh-Kulkarni.  


I was previously working in research. I worked as a Research Associate (Postdoc) in the lab of Dr. Tobias Reichenbach at the Department of Bioengineering at 
Imperial College London. I develop algorithms to analyse neural data obtained through various experimental procedures and computational models 
to help explain the underlying neural principles. I have a Ph.D in statistical physics and neuroscience and 4+ years experience obtaining and 
analysing complex and multi-dimensional data using advanced statistics, network simulations and custom-built algorithms.

- 👀 I currently work in Auditory neuroscience and the computational modeling of multisensory speech processing in the Auditory cortex. I worked previously 
with Dr. Romain Brette on understanding the action potential mechanism in Paramecium at the Institut de la Vision in Paris. Prior to that, I graduated with a PhD in 2017 from UPMC, Paris while working 
at LPS, ENS, Paris where I researched on propagation of brain waves in the group of Dr. Vincent Hakim and on the Motion After Effect illusion and glial cells
in zebrafish in the group of Dr. German Sumbre. I did my masters in Optics, Nanosciences and Condensed Matter Physics at Ecole Polytechnique 
in Paris and my undergraduate major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Theoretical Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai. 

- 🌱 I enjoy teaching and have been a Teaching Assistant for the courses of Probability and Statistics, Computational Neuroscience and Reinforcement learning. 
I am also learning more about Data science and Machine learning to keep up with the world of AI.

- 💞️ In my free time, I like to do some science dissemination and recently started a Science Blog on Medium https://medium.com/@vigyaan 
exploring various new advances in science.
